Nashville City Cemetery Data Analysis

Welcome to the Nashville City Cemetery data analysis project. This README provides an overview of the dataset and steps for analyzing and visualizing historical burial data.

Technology Used: Microsoft Excel

Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes burial records from 1846 to 1979, reflecting historical trends in medicine, literacy, and more. It may contain inconsistencies due to its handwritten origins.

Objectives:
The objectives of this project are to explore and clean the data, perform analysis using pivot tables, XLOOKUPs, visualizations, and other key Excel functions, and create marketing materials.

Steps:
1. Initial Data Exploration:
Start by reviewing the metadata to understand the contents of each column in the dataset.

2. Analysis Tasks
   
a. Causes of Death:
Begin by creating a pivot table to identify and evaluate the 10 most common causes of death. Correct spelling errors in the dataset as needed and update the data. Visualize the top 10 causes of death with a bar chart.

b. Burials Over Time:
Create a line chart to show the number of burials per year, describing the overall trends and identifying peak years. For a more detailed analysis, use a pivot table to examine burials by year and month. Apply [conditional formatting](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-conditional-formatting-to-highlight-information-fed60dfa-1d3f-4e13-9ecb-f1951ff89d7f) to highlight variations in burial counts and investigate months with notable variations.

c. Decade-Based Analysis:
Add a column to categorize burials by decade. Analyze these categories and create a clustered bar chart to visualize the trends in male versus female burials over time.

d. Age Group Analysis:
Classify ages into categories such as 0-18, 19-25, and so on, and handle any missing values. Divide records into year ranges and perform a proportion analysis by using a grouped bar chart to show trends in age group distributions over time.

e. Last Names:
Extract last names from the Name column and handle any errors due to missing commas. Analyze the common last names and identify any notable individuals.

f. Civil War Era Analysis:
Filter the dataset to create a "Burials_1864" sheet. Classify individuals into age categories like "Infant," "Child," or "Adult." Calculate the mean age for each category, use the DATE() function to combine year, month, and day into a burial date, and determine the last infant buried in 1864.

Marketing Materials

Identify key findings from the analysis and create engaging visualizations to effectively communicate these insights. Prepare a concise presentation focused on these findings for marketing purposes.
